This python script is an example of using one of the simplest machine learning algorithms, linear regression, to predict house prices in
Boston. 

Linear regression is an algorithm generally used for creating a straight line of best fit through several data points, provided through training data. Then, from training, we will have a model of the form y=wx+b. 

The dataset I used is from sklearn (see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_boston.html).

For this dataset, we have 13 features: CRIM (per capita crime rate), ZN (proportion of residential land zoned)
